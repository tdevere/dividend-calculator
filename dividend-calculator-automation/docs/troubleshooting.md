# Troubleshooting Tips for Dividend Calculator Automation

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Feature Branch Creation Fails
**Issue**: The script to create a feature branch fails with an error message.
**Solution**: Ensure that you have the correct permissions to create branches in the repository. Check if the branch already exists or if there are any naming conflicts.

### 2. Code Generation Errors
**Issue**: The code generation script does not produce the expected output.
**Solution**: Verify that the feature requirements are correctly formatted and match the expected structure. Check the templates used for code generation for any syntax errors.

### 3. Test Failures
**Issue**: Tests fail after code generation.
**Solution**: Review the test output for specific error messages. Ensure that the generated code adheres to the expected interfaces and types. Update the tests if necessary to accommodate changes in the code.

### 4. Validation Issues
**Issue**: The feature validation process reports errors.
**Solution**: Check the validation rules defined in the `FeatureValidator` class. Ensure that the generated code meets all specified requirements and that the validation logic is correctly implemented.

### 5. Deployment Failures
**Issue**: The application fails to deploy after merging the pull request.
**Solution**: Review the deployment logs for any error messages. Ensure that the deployment configuration is correct and that all necessary environment variables are set in Azure App Service.

### 6. GitHub Actions Workflow Errors
**Issue**: The GitHub Actions workflows do not trigger as expected.
**Solution**: Check the workflow configuration files for any syntax errors. Ensure that the triggers are correctly defined and that the workflows are enabled in the repository settings.

### 7. Performance Issues
**Issue**: The automation process is slow or unresponsive.
**Solution**: Monitor the resource usage of the self-hosted runners. Consider optimizing the code generation and testing processes. Review the logs for any bottlenecks or errors.

### 8. Integration Problems
**Issue**: Issues arise when integrating with external APIs or services.
**Solution**: Verify the API keys and access tokens used in the integration. Check the network connectivity and ensure that the services are operational.
