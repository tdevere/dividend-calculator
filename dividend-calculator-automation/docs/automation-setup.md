# Automation System Setup Instructions

This document provides a comprehensive guide to setting up the automated feature development system for the Dividend Calculator project. The automation system leverages GitHub Actions to streamline the process of creating feature branches, generating code, running tests, and deploying the application.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository**: Ensure you have a GitHub repository set up for the Dividend Calculator project.
2. **Node.js**: Install Node.js (version 20 or higher) on your local machine.
3. **GitHub Actions**: Familiarize yourself with GitHub Actions and workflows.

## Step 1: Configure GitHub Actions Workflows

The automation system is powered by several GitHub Actions workflows located in the `.github/workflows` directory. These workflows are responsible for different stages of the automation process:

- **feature-automation.yml**: Triggers on push events, reads feature requirements, creates a new branch, and initiates the development process.
- **feature-validation.yml**: Validates the generated code and tests after the feature automation workflow completes.
- **auto-merge.yml**: Automatically merges pull requests once tests pass and code is validated.
- **deployment.yml**: Defines the deployment process for the application after successful merges.

## Step 2: Set Up Scripts

The scripts located in the `.github/scripts` directory handle various tasks in the automation process:

- **create-feature-branch.js**: Creates a new feature branch based on the provided requirements.
- **generate-code.js**: Generates code based on the feature requirements using predefined templates.
- **run-tests.js**: Executes the tests associated with the generated code to ensure functionality.
- **validate-feature.js**: Validates the generated feature against the requirements and checks for compliance.

## Step 3: Implement Automation Agents

The automation agents located in the `automation/agents` directory are responsible for specific tasks:

- **codeGenerator.ts**: Contains methods for generating code based on feature requirements.
- **testRunner.ts**: Executes tests and reports results.
- **featureValidator.ts**: Validates features against requirements.
- **deploymentManager.ts**: Manages the deployment process.

## Step 4: Create Feature Requests

Users can submit feature requests using the template located in `.github/templates/feature-request.md`. This template outlines the structure for providing requirements, which the automation system will use to generate code.

## Step 5: Monitor Automation Processes

The automation dashboard component located in `src/components/automation/AutomationDashboard.tsx` displays the status of ongoing automation processes. Users can monitor the progress of feature development and deployment.

## Step 6: Testing and Validation

Ensure that all tests are defined in the `tests` directory. The automation system will run these tests to validate the generated code and ensure that it meets the specified requirements.

## Step 7: Deployment

Once the feature is validated and merged, the deployment workflow will trigger, deploying the application to the specified environment.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will set up an automated system for feature development in the Dividend Calculator project. This system will enhance productivity and ensure that new features are developed, tested, and deployed efficiently.
