# Dividend Calculator Automation

This project automates the feature development process for the Dividend Calculator application using GitHub Actions. It allows users to submit feature requests, which are then processed to create new branches, generate code, run tests, and deploy the application automatically.

## Features

- **Automated Feature Development**: Users can submit feature requests, which trigger an automated workflow to create a new branch and develop the feature.
- **Code Generation**: The system generates code based on predefined templates tailored to the feature requirements.
- **Testing**: Automated tests are run to ensure the generated code functions as expected.
- **Validation**: The generated code is validated against the specified requirements to ensure compliance.
- **Deployment**: Upon successful validation and testing, the application is automatically deployed to the specified environment.

## Project Structure

- **.github**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows, templates for feature requests and pull requests, and scripts for automation tasks.
- **automation**: Contains agents for code generation, testing, feature validation, and deployment management, along with templates and configuration files.
- **src**: Contains the source code for the Dividend Calculator application, including components, API interactions, utilities, and type definitions.
