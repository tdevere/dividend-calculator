# Code Generation Prompts

This document outlines the prompts used to guide the code generation process for the Dividend Calculator automation system. The prompts are designed to ensure that the generated code meets the specified feature requirements and adheres to best practices.

## Prompts for Code Generation

1. **Feature Description**: 
   - Provide a clear and concise description of the feature you want to implement. Include any specific requirements or constraints.

2. **User Stories**: 
   - Describe the user stories associated with this feature. What are the goals of the users? How will they interact with the feature?

3. **Acceptance Criteria**: 
   - List the acceptance criteria that must be met for the feature to be considered complete. This should include functional and non-functional requirements.

4. **Component Structure**: 
   - Specify the structure of the components that will be generated. Include details about props, state management, and any necessary lifecycle methods.

5. **API Integration**: 
   - If the feature requires API calls, outline the endpoints that will be used, the expected request and response formats, and any authentication requirements.

6. **Testing Requirements**: 
   - Define the testing requirements for the generated code. What types of tests should be created (unit, integration, end-to-end)? What scenarios should be covered?

7. **Code Style Guidelines**: 
   - Specify any code style guidelines that should be followed during code generation, such as naming conventions, formatting rules, and documentation standards.

8. **Additional Notes**: 
   - Include any additional notes or considerations that may be relevant to the code generation process. This could include references to existing code, design patterns, or libraries to be used.

By following these prompts, the automation system will be able to generate code that aligns with the specified feature requirements and enhances the overall quality of the application.
