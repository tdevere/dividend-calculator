## Test Creation Prompts

1. **Test Coverage Requirements**:
   - What functionalities should be covered by the tests?
   - Are there specific edge cases that need to be tested?

2. **Testing Framework**:
   - Which testing framework should be used (e.g., Jest, Mocha)?
   - Are there any specific configurations or plugins required for the testing framework?

3. **Mocking Dependencies**:
   - Are there any external dependencies that need to be mocked?
   - What are the expected behaviors of these dependencies during testing?

4. **Test Structure**:
   - Should the tests follow a specific structure or naming convention?
   - Are there any existing test files that can serve as a reference?

5. **Assertions**:
   - What assertions should be made in the tests?
   - Are there specific outcomes that need to be validated?

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Are there any performance benchmarks that the tests should validate?
   - Should any tests be marked as performance tests?

7. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Should the tests be run in a specific environment (e.g., staging, production)?
   - Are there any specific CI/CD configurations required for running the tests?

8. **Documentation**:
   - Should the tests include comments or documentation for clarity?
   - Are there any guidelines for writing test documentation?
